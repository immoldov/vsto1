# vsto1
In short:
- the "add in" writes to a file on the local machine 
- a python aplication is taling the file and takes action (did not creat this)

How to: 
- install Visual Studio on a windows machine 
- Open this VSTO aplication 
- Click "Start"
- an "add in" will install for your installed outlock aplication 
- open the "add in" and "click here "
- assumes this file "C:\Users\mldvn\test\WriteLines.txt" exits (you can hardcode any path here)
- will write 3 lines to the txt file
